# Vibrating-Chess-Toy
This script is an integration between stockfish chess ai and remote controllable vibrating adult toys.  

This script works via https://buttplug.io, https://stockfishchess.org and https://intiface.com
The script-folder contains the VibraChess1.3.exe, which is the main script, and a folder called stockfish. There lays stockfish.exe. After the start of the script, it tells you to insert the stockfish path. You have to copy the path to the stockfish.exe in the cmd. On Windows you can right-click on the .exe and press "copy path".
After you inserted the stockfish path, you have to type "Yes", when you startet you're intiface webserver. If you don't have it already you have to first install Intiface. Now you can start it and press start scanning to connect you're toys. 
Now you can insert the vibration duration in seconds or just hit enter to load default settings.
After this the script asks you for the vibration strength. You can also hit enter to just skip. 
After a few seconds you can type the opponents move and the script will vibrate you're best possible move.
You can now hit enter or type the move you did, if you not did the move, that the script suggested.
